## Project Overview
This project aims to predict clients who are likely to default on home equity loans using various machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset includes historical loan data, client information, and default status.

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Model Training and Evaluation using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 85% with the XGBoost model.
- Key features influencing default prediction were identified.

## Files
